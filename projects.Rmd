title: "The efficacy of a computing-concepts video library for students and peer tutors in multidisciplinary contexts"
---

## Project abstract

This project aims to serve the national interest by preparing students in non-computing majors to use computational techniques in their academic work and future careers. Increasingly, students in all disciplines must learn to use computing technology. To meet the increased need for students to use computational methods across all fields, non-computing courses commonly integrate computational components into their curricula. However, many non-computing faculty are not prepared to teach the computing concepts that underlie the computational techniques that their students must master. This project will support non-computing faculty who are teaching computing concepts by developing a curated set of videos that provides the content needed for students to learn basic computing concepts. The infusion of foundational computing concepts into non-computing courses will increase both the number and diversity of students who are prepared to utilize computational technologies when they enter the workforce.

This project's goals are to (1) expand and strengthen the OCCTIVE video library (Online Computing-Concepts Toolkit of Interdisciplinary Videos for Education), designed to introduce foundational computing concepts in non-CS courses, (2) broadly disseminate OCCTIVE for use by non-CS faculty and peer tutors, and (3) assess the impact of OCCTIVE use on students, faculty, and peer tutors. The expansion and improvement of the OCCTIVE library will be informed by best practices in instructional video design. The videos will be supplemented with sample teaching material and other support materials that aid faculty adoption. Faculty, who will be recruited from a wide range of disciplines and institutions, will be trained to integrate OCCTIVE into their courses through in person and virtual workshops. The efficacy of the OCCTIVE library will be measured by assessing students' comprehension of computing concepts, faculty's adoption of materials in their classes, and peer tutor experiences. The NSF IUSE: EDU Program supports research and development projects to improve the effectiveness of STEM education for all students. Through the Engaged Student Learning track, the program supports the creation, exploration, and implementation of promising practices and tools.
