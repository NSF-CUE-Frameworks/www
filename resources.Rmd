## Guide to Videos

Check out the [full video list](./guide.html) and a [flowchart](https://docs.google.com/drawings/d/1lD1CxMXV6G_83KfyaABuvqY-g2SodAKmKiVu3FFWMo8/edit?usp=sharing) that shows video dependencies.

All videos have captions unless otherwise indicated.  

## Video Captions

If interested in searching for coverage of a particular topic, the complete captions of all videos are viewable [here](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Aj2NEE8PwzdjAXffKrh6OV3lafPbbTgQUC4FqYzBYcE/edit?usp=sharing).

## Sample Exercises

This [document](gfx/Example Exercises.pdf) contains a number of exercises that provide examples for faculty who would like to create their own reinforcing exercises students can work on after watching the videos.
